nmap <permissions> <IP address, range>
	
	Scans the network, gathers information and reports.

Some permissions:
	-T<1 to 5>:			speed of scan, higher the number, greater the speed, lower the accuracy and vice versa.
	-sn:				scans the network excludes the ports.
	-sS:				stealth scan, no SYN ACK sent, instead RST.
	-p <port range>:		scan specified ports.
						example: -p1-6000,  -p 443, -p-(all ports)
	--exclude-ports <ports>:	ports to be excluded from scan.
	--top-ports <ports>:		scan most common ports.
	-D <IP addresses>:		decoy IPs.
	-S <IP address>:		spoofs the source IP.
	--proxies <urls>:		use of proxies.
	--spoof-mac <addr, prefix>:	spoofs source mac address.
	-A:				all: OS detection, version, etc.
	-oA:				stores result in 3 major formants, txt, xml, grepable
	-sU:				UDP scan, lots of false positives.
	
staging:
	first quick scan, then deep scan. get all open port from quick scans, and do deep scan on them.
	on doing quick scan we get:

	PORT      STATE    SERVICE
	21/tcp    filtered ftp
	22/tcp    open     ssh
	23/tcp    filtered telnet
	53/tcp    open     domain
	80/tcp    open     http
	5555/tcp  open     freeciv
	7547/tcp  open     cwmp
	49152/tcp open     unknown

	while doing deep scan instead of using nmap -T4 -A -p- 192.168.1.1, we can use nmap -T4 -A -p 21,22,23,53,80,5555,7547,49152 192.168.1.1
	reducing our efforts.

nmap scripts:
	/usr/share/nmap/scripts/
	use accordingly, wildcards *
	if want to run all scripts, name starting with ssh, type: "ssh-*"
	all this can be combined with boolean expressions.
	example: --script: "default or broadcast"
		 --script: "not vuln" runs scripts that doesnt contain vuln
