TCP Protocol: total control protocol

3 way handskake
computer1 --> computer2(lets say port 443) 
    this is "SYN"
computer1 <-- computer2 (reponds back)
    this is "SYN ACK"
computer1 --> computer2 (replies back)
    this is "ACK"

In stealth scan doesnt establish connection by NOT doing the "ACK" part, and not detected by firewall.
